# Food Barcode Scanner Android

This Android app includes Sign-In, Sign-Up functionalities. </br>
It can scan food products' barcodes and display relative barcode data. </br>
Data is communicated through Firebase Real-Time Database. </br>
Barcode Scan is using a 3rd party library from Zxing Android Embedded Barcode Scan. </br>

## Open the Project

Using Android Studio to open the project's root directory. </br>

## Run the App

You need a real device not a simulate to be able to scan the barcode. I use HUAWEI DRA-AL00 (Adroid Version 8.1.0) for testing. </br>
There are two barcode images in this directory you can use them for testing. </br>
These two barcodes have related data in the database. </br>
