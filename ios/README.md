# Food Barcode Scanner iOS

This iOS app includes Sign-In, Sign-Up functionalities. </br>
It can scan food products' barcodes and display relative barcode data. </br>
Data is communicated through Firebase Real-Time Database. </br>
Barcode Scan is using a 3rd party library called Code Scanner. </br>

## Open the Project

This iOS app uses Cocoapods. </br>
So to open the project in Xcode, open .xcworkspace file instead of .xcodeproj file. </br>

## Run the App

You need a real device not a simulate to be able to scan the barcode. I use iPhone 12 Pro Max for testing. </br>
There are two barcode images in this directory you can use them for testing. </br>
These two barcodes have related data in the database. </br>
